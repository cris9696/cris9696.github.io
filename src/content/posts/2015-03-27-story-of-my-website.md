This Website changed a lot during its development. In a few months I switched styles, technologies, content. Here are some videos and details about each major version.

### First Version - August 2014

This first version was **awful** but at the time it looked **amazing** to me. I spent many hours on it but the problems where everywhere: a lot of text, nothing interesting and really bad styling overall. But **it was a start** (and it was responsive).

I also installed a blog powered by WordPress for this first version. I made the theme from scratch and even that theme looked quite good to me but not as good as the main website.

**What I used for the first version**

*   HTML5
*   Sass
*   FontAwesome
*   Wordpress


### Second Version - January 2015

In the time between the first and this version I learnt a lot of things and overall **improved** my web-related skills. I decided it was time to **remake** the website, from scratch. The one I had at the time was not something I was proud of and it **didn't look so good** now.

I tried to make it look more **fresh** and clean: I decided to drop most of the text and instead add 3 lists that told what I was capable of doing. But still **it wasn't perfect**! The lists were a bit "off" and I didn't like the last block with links to other stuff. It was also lacking a blog.


**What I used for the second version**

*   HTML5
*   Sass + Bourbon.io
*   SVG Icons

### Third Version - March 2015

This is the current version of the Website, right now it **looks good to me**. But every now and then I find a few things to tweak and fix. I replaced the list with a **showcase** of the projects I worked on. I think that (at least on my website) what I worked on is more important than what I know. I also spent a few time focusing on typhograpy.

I rebuilt the Blog from scratch this time using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. For a simple blog it is **easier**,**faster** and **better than Wordpress**. I also integrated a preview of my latest post in the Home Page!

**What I used for the third version**

*   HTML5
*   Sass + Bourbon.io
*   Jekyll + Github Pages


**What it's missing**

*   A Resume
*   A Contact Form
