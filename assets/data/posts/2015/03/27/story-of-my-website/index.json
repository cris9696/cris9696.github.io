In a few months I switched styles, technologies, content. Here are some videos and details about each major version.</p>\n<h3 id=\"first-version---august-2014\"><a href=\"#first-version---august-2014\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>First Version - August 2014</h3>\n<p><video src=\"/video/v1.webm\" controls></video></p>\n<p>This first version was <strong>awful</strong> but at the time it looked <strong>amazing</strong> to me. I spent many hours on it but the problems where everywhere: a lot of text, nothing interesting and really bad styling overall. But <strong>it was a start</strong> (and it was responsive).</p>\n<p>I also installed a blog powered by WordPress for this first version. I made the theme from scratch and even that theme looked quite good to me but not as good as the main website.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/video/v1blog.webm\">Here's a video about the first version of the Blog</a></p>\n<p><strong>What I used for the first version</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>HTML5</li>\n<li>Sass</li>\n<li>FontAwesome</li>\n<li>Wordpress</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"second-version---january-2015\"><a href=\"#second-version---january-2015\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Second Version - January 2015</h3>\n<p><video src=\"/video/v2.webm\" controls></video></p>\n<p>In the time between the first and this version I learnt a lot of things and overall <strong>improved</strong> my web-related skills. I decided it was time to <strong>remake</strong> the website, from scratch. The one I had at the time was not something I was proud of and it <strong>didn't look so good</strong> now.</p>\n<p>I tried to make it look more <strong>fresh</strong> and clean: I decided to drop most of the text and instead add 3 lists that told what I was capable of doing. But still <strong>it wasn't perfect</strong>! The lists were a bit \"off\" and I didn't like the last block with links to other stuff. It was also lacking a blog.</p>\n<p><strong>What I used for the second version</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>HTML5</li>\n<li>Sass + Bourbon.io</li>\n<li>SVG Icons</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"third-version---march-2015\"><a href=\"#third-version---march-2015\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Third Version - March 2015</h3>\n<p><video src=\"/video/v3.webm\" controls></video></p>\n<p>This is the current version of the Website, right now it <strong>looks good to me</strong>. But every now and then I find a few things to tweak and fix. I replaced the list with a <strong>showcase</strong> of the projects I worked on. I think that (at least on my website) what I worked on is more important than what I know. I also spent a few time focusing on typhograpy.</p>\n<p>I rebuilt the Blog from scratch this time using <a href=\"http://jekyllrb.com/\">Jekyll</a>. For a simple blog it is <strong>easier</strong>,<strong>faster</strong> and <strong>better than Wordpress</strong>. I also integrated a preview of my latest post in the Home Page!</p>\n<p><a href=\"/video/v3blog.webm\">Here's a video about the current version of the Blog</a></p>\n<p><strong>What I used for the third version</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>HTML5</li>\n<li>Sass + Bourbon.io</li>\n<li>Jekyll + Github Pages</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>What it's missing</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>A Resume</li>\n<li>A Contact Form</li>\n</ul>\n"}},"context":{}}
